The Left is in a moment when "inevitability" is further than ever from
referring to what it once did, Marx's prophecy of revolution. It has come to
mean instead the inescapability of the world economic system, the sense that if
a revolution were coming it would have already. The crisis-prone nature of
capitalism is ever further naturalized, even more so as the authors of each
successive crisis are paid off for their trouble and the same risky financial
vehicles are trotted out with new, equally obfuscatory names and the same
underlying flaws. Opposing it, to the layman, seems more and more like voting
against the weather. As Fredric Jameson puts it, "What is crippling is...the
universal belief, not only that this tendency is irreversible, but that the
historic alternatives to capitalism have proven unviable and impossible, and
that no other socioeconomic system is conceivable, let alone practically
available" (xii). In response to this perceived inevitability, he points to
Utopianism in political and, most relevant for my purposes, literary contexts
as the first essential step in finding a way beyond the current social system.
He believes this so strongly that he claims "one cannot imagine any fundamental
change in our social existence which has not first thrown off Utopian visions
like so many sparks from a comet" (xii). The greater a broken system's
perceived permanence, it would seem, the more desperately such a trail of
sparks is needed.

In no context is this inevitability more "crippling" than in environmentalism,
over which the specters of climate change and a desperately battered biome loom
ever larger---speaking of "voting against the weather." And yet, though there
may be further to go here than anywhere, there is reason to believe that we are
further along the way. Consensus among world leaders that radical action is
necessary exceeds almost any comparable issue, and opposing this conclusion
looks increasingly like madness. Naomi Klein's recent book, *This Changes
Everything*, argues that the dire necessity of systemic change in response to
climate change can and must be platform for the social platform of the
Left---and indeed, that no lesser degree or alternative form of change will be
sufficient to prevent disastrous change to the climate. Despite the necessity
of radical, global social change and the apparent readiness of the political
forces involved across the spectrum, there is so far no recognizable and
avowedly Utopian environmentalist movement. This is not to say that there are
not examples of green Utopianism, historical and contemporary, literary and
actual: they are many and various. But they are not yet recognized as an
historical movement in the way that Utopianism in general is, and they have not
been granted the importance to environmentalism as Jameson grants his "sparks."
At least in literary terms, the studies bringing these isolated actions into a
movement have not yet been done.

It is beyond the scope of this or any single paper to trace in full what I am
calling the "ecotopian imagination." But in beginning to approach the topic as
it appears in American fiction, it will first be necessary to theoretically
develop the term itself and test its usefulness in a condensed case study. I
will use this space to begin both of these tasks. First, I will continue to
read Fredric Jameson's meditations on Utopianism in *Archaeologies of the
Future*, setting it against the recent surface reading movement to ask what an
ecotopian analysis must do. I will then take the term as an occasion to read
two related moments in two Willa Cather novels against each other, asking how
two different imaginative reconstructions of a single space ...[etc]

Walter Benjamin tells us in his "Theses on the Philosophy of History" that to
make an historical articulation of the past "means to seize hold of a memory as
it flashes up at a moment of danger"---for such an image of the past
"only...flashes up at the instant when it can be recognized" (255). In moments
such as this, when a globalized system of production has rearranged the pieces
of the world and disrupted most regional ecosystems, images of enclosed systems
are particularly recognizable as environmentally useful paradigms. Jameson
identifies such images as fundamental to Utopianism. He defines "totality" as
"precisely this combination of closure and system, in the name of autonomy and
self-sufficiency" and says that such totality can be "ultimately the source
of...otherness or radical, even alien, difference" (5). From an environmental
perspective, this framing of Utopianism is quite appealing. In the first place,
the closed system has been an important aspect of ecological thought since
ecological thought existed. Whether in the form of Darwin's discoveries in the
Galapagos, the Biosphere 2 lab in Arizona, or "Spaceship Earth" as an early
paradigm of sustainability in U.S. political discourse, the concept recurs in
many different forms. 

It remains to be seen what the Utopian version of this closure brings to
ecological analysis that ecological analysis does not already have. The
emphasis on autonomy and self-sufficiency offers the beginnings of an answer:
these concepts forge a link between the closed ecological system and historical
instances of separation and autonomy, letting one ask how ecological factors
might interact with concepts of the nation state and sovereignty.  Emphasizing
"difference" as a feature of Utopian totality may also let us draw lines
between the evolutionary processes of differentiation, ecological diversity,
and difference in the sense of culture and identity. What ends up being seen in
many cases is that ecological differentiation tends to go hand in hand with
other forms of difference: sexual, national, economic, and "cultural" more
broadly.

In asking what using the ecotopian imagination as a basis of inquiry can show
us about a text, then, we must pose several pointed questions. First, what is
the closed system in question, and in what conditions does it arise? Second,
what unique characteristics can we detect in the material conditions of this
closed system---its ecology, spatial characteristics, built environment---and
what can this *reading for material* tell us about the social systems those
material traces enable? And finally, how do the material aspects of this unique
space contribute to the thematic apparatus of the text? This last point can be
further specified to emphasize situations in which difference of any sort,
perhaps especially sexual difference and cultural "contact zones," comes into
play. 

Willa Cather's novel *The Professor's House* (the "Tom Outland's Story" section
specifically) offers an excellent starting point for this analysis, as it is
one of two novels from her that offer ecotopian presentations of what amount to
the same space in many senses, cliff cities in differing states of ruin. While
the cliff city in *Death Comes for the Archbishop* was built by Ácoma, the city
in *The Professor's House* was the home of a long-dead and unknown tribe; this
detail is important for reasons that will be discussed, but the narrative
purpose of the spaces is quite similar. 

The time when the cliff city in *Professor* is discovered puts a special
emphasis on its status as an alternative domicile that functions differently
from the "home" in the moment's dominant culture. Tom Outland, an orphaned
young man working as a cowboy when the story takes place, is tending a herd
with a friend, Roddy. Most critics agree that Tom and Roddy have a heterosocial
relationship with strong romantic overtones, but this romance only expresses
itself in the alternative family unit Tom and Roddy establish with their
assistant and temporary housekeeper, Henry. At the time the Ácoma cliff city is
discovered, the three of them have established routines of masculine
housekeeping that forms a strong counterpoint with the traditional,
heterosexual forms of housekeeping that dominate the novel's narration and
thematic arc.[^housekeeping] By the time Tom discovers the cliff city, these
men have already formed a kind of Utopian enclave of their own: none of them
has been able to exist to their comfort in the heterosexual, capitalist form of
the home; all are on the run from the dominant culture of the *oikos* in one
sense or another. I use the term *oikos* to denote the intersection of the
"home," *oikos*'s literal translation from the Greek, and economy and ecology,
which have *oikos* in their etymological root (oiko-nomia and oiko-logia). This
temporary Utopian space of the cabin, however, is defined by impermanence, and
it is understood that all of them will have to move on soon to a situation
where their difference will again cause them to be ostracized. It is important
to elaborate in detail the moment they encounter the cliff city, because any
Utopian construct, as Jameson shows elsewhere, arises as a complex response
that exceeds the possibilities of its moment.[^utopian-moment] 

What Tom connects with so strongly in the cliff city---and, I suggest, *reads
into* the physical traces of the cliff city---is the elements that make it
self-sustaining and, therefore, socially and politically autonomous. The
details he picks out emphasize the conditions necessary for autonomy, and his
interpretation of them show that his perception of them is colored by the
difference in his own identity in terms of the dominant culture of the *oikos*.
The bulk of the details he picks out place emphasis on the natural protections
offered by the cliff city's location. He offers a litany of evidence for the
cleanliness and absolute lack of "disorder" in the cliff city: "everything
seemed open and clean," he says, and almost every stone surface that is
described has been "smoothly polished" and remains so (206, 211). Every
implication is that an area with fewer natural protections would in some way
have degraded, but that the very features that kept the cliff city
self-sustaining and autonomous for its inhabitants has also allowed it to
remain so for the duration between their departure and Tom's arrival.
Cleanliness due to what Tom calls nature's "housekeep[ing]" becomes a physical
marker of the natural protections offered by the cliff city (206). For a novel
intimately concerned with history, housekeeping, and personal autonomy, this is
an important association.

Of more immediate concern are the traces of sustainable infrastructure that
allow Tom's imagination to pivot from the purely descriptive spatial
imagination to the more obviously Utopian social imagination. Tom gives a great
deal of attention to the presence of a cold spring, and later an
archaeologically minded priest (probably an anticipation of Latour from *Death
Comes for the Archbishop*) points out the presence of granaries (217).  It is
finally revealed that the inhabitants of this cliff city kept their farms and
their home separate, practicing agriculture and hunting in the plains beyond
the city and stockpiling grain to be as self-sufficient as possible (216-20).
The final detail and the one most distinctly held up for celebration is that
this agricultural model of external growth and internal stockpiling allows the
independent development of cultural and social forms that have no external
influence or determinant. Father Dûchene describes them, based on the same
traces Tom and Roddy have seen, as "cut off here without influence of example
or emulation, with no incentive but some natural yearning for order and
security," contrasting them with an earlier description of other civilizations
as murderous and bloodthirsty. Everything that Tom's recollection includes
about the physical space points to the link between the agricultural system and
the autonomous cultural unit it enables in the cliff city. What he needs out of
this space is protection and the ability to develop his own way of being in the
world, and he creates the conditions to satisfy this need in his interpretation
of the physical space and its agricultural support system.

But ultimately, for the purposes of the *novel* (if such can be separated from
Tom's own needs as a character), the space provides an opportunity to meditate
on the conditions under which alternative forms of domestic labor could exist.
The agricultural system that supports the space of the cliff cities enables the
development of this system by providing different labor conditions than those
that pertained in the development of America. Agricultural production for the
sake of stockpiling implies a seasonal division of different types of labor,
with the society's resources put to the task of sowing and harvesting for part
of the year and devoted to communal "housekeeping" and leisure for the rest of
it. The non-agricultural part of the year appears to lead to novel social
formations: Tom finds evidence of a communal kitchen, which is a recurring
theme in the minds of Utopian domestic labor reformers like Charlotte Perkins
Gilman, and the description of individual domiciles stacked like a "beehive"
implies a greater degree of communal existence and shared space than that which
defines the American home. 

To summarize, while Tom's own ecotopian imagination merely emphasizes autonomy,
separation, and protection in his interpretation of the cliff city's physical
remains, Cather uses the social inventiveness the space enables in pursuing the
larger theme of domestic labor in her novel. The essential aspect of the
ecotopian imagination revealed in Cather's case is that imagining novel social
forms necessitates imagining the material conditions in which they would arise:
the hazily defined community relies on the specific agricultural system of the
cliff city. 

A very similar relationship exists between the agricultural model and physical
space in the Ácoma cliff city in *Death Comes for the Archbishop*, and many of
the same physical traces remain. But because the space exists in a complex
middle ground between the human desires of Father Latour and Cather's narrative
requirements for the novel as a whole (not to mention her own desires), the
spatial imaginary is notably different. 

Many of the defining features of this spatial-economic dyad return in *Bishop*.
The Ácoma share the same division of interior and exterior space, with physical
needs satisfied by agriculture and hunting beyond the walls of the cliff city
and the city itself standing as a hybrid of safety and culture. The
interpretation of them, however, shifts according to the circumstances of the
novel. Everything that Father Latour sees is cast in a religious light: mesas
are "generally Gothic in outline, resembling vast cathedrals"; Earth and heaven
become coextensive in the site of the mesas, which are "inconceivable without
their attendant clouds, which were part of them, as the smoke is part of the
censer"; the safety of the perch is glossed as "Sanctuary!" (94,95,97). The
spatial imagination---not to say that it is precisely ecotopian in these
instances---shows its brush strokes, dabbing religious significance over the
city and its setting in what is clearly Latour's own perspective.

Descriptions which we might rightly attribute to Latour are hardly the only
sites of religious re-casting, however. The narrative construction of physical
space---and perhaps most important, the narration *of* the space's
construction---likewise account for the different narrative requirements for
the space. The architectural corollary to a watchtower in *The Professor's
House* is a church spire in the crumbling Ácoma mission, adding spiritual
redemption to physical protection. Reading this structure is somewhat
complicated by the knowledge that the Ácoma mission is an actually existing
site, and not the result solely of narrative construction. But there is room to
trace Cather's spatial invention the margins of the actual space: with
"deep-worn paths...washed white and clean" like the hallmarks of the cliff city
in *Professor*, she leads us again to "cisterns...full of fresh rain water"
that allow, in combination with "a secret spring below," human life to thrive
where the only other life is poisonous nightshade (98-9). Sustaining
infrastructure again leads to absolute separation, autonomy, and the
maintenance of difference up to a certain point. But unlike in *Professor*,
absolute separation is as strangling as partial separation is nourishing.
Latour learns that another nearby village with similar spatial characteristics
"perished from hunger" when their lone "stairway...was broken off by a great
storm many centuries ago" (96). The danger of absolute autonomy is set next to
its cultural necessity in a way similar depictions in *Professor* are unable to
recognize.

The reason for this middle state between absolute separation and uncomplicated
intercourse with the rest of the world is clarified by context: the space is an
occasion for meditation on the role of the closed system in ecological,
historical, and spiritual terms, all of which perspectives are essential to the
novel in varying degrees. Indeed, these perspectives can be said to come
together, even come to conflict, in the depiction of the Ácoma city. Latour's
journey is ultimately a religious mission, a pursuit of spiritual change and
cultural erasure. Among the thematic tensions of the novel is the contradiction
between a religious perspective of necessary salvation and consciousness of
historical conquest---all combined with a sensitivity to difference in his
interactions with the half-converted indigenous people of New Mexico. While it
is unclear to what extent he is conscious of this goal, Cather sets up Latour's
character arc as the earnest pursuit of his religious mission while trying not
to replicating the sins of historical conquest.

[^housekeeping]: I will try not to spend too much time discussing this
housekeeping *per se*, as I have already written on the topic at length in a
paper I turned in to Prof. Graham last year. Suffice it to say there is a lot
more to this housekeeping than meets the eye.
