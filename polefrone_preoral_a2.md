# The Ecotopian Imagination in Two Cather Novels

For the Left, "inevitability" is further than ever from referring to what it
once did, Marx's prophecy of revolution. It has come instead to mean the
inescapability of the world economic system, the sense that if a revolution
were coming, it already would have arrived. The crisis-prone nature of
capitalism is ever further naturalized in our discourse, even more so as the
authors of each successive crisis are paid off for their trouble and the same
risky financial vehicles are trotted out with new, equally obfuscatory names
and the same underlying flaws. Opposing it, to the layman, seems more and more
like voting against the weather. As Fredric Jameson puts it, "What is crippling
is...the universal belief, not only that this tendency is irreversible, but
that the historic alternatives to capitalism have proven unviable and
impossible, and that no other socioeconomic system is conceivable, let alone
practically available" (xii). In response to this perceived inevitability, he
points to Utopianism in political and, most relevant for my purposes, literary
contexts as an essential step in finding a way beyond the current social
system. He believes this so strongly that he claims "one cannot imagine any
fundamental change in our social existence which has not first thrown off
Utopian visions like so many sparks from a comet" (xii). The greater a broken
system's perceived permanence, it would seem, the more desperately such a trail
of sparks is needed.

In no context is this inevitability more "crippling" than in environmentalism,
over which the specters of climate change and a desperately battered biome loom
ever larger (speaking of "voting against the weather"). But even though there
may be further to go there than anywhere, there is reason to believe that we
are further along the way. Consensus among world leaders that radical action is
necessary exceeds almost any comparable issue, and opposing this conclusion
looks increasingly like madness. Naomi Klein's recent book, *This Changes
Everything*, argues that the dire necessity of systemic change in response to
climate change can and must be an occasion to push the social platform of the
Left---and indeed, that no lesser degree or alternative form of change will be
sufficient to prevent catastrophic change to the climate. And yet, despite the
necessity of radical, global social change and the apparent readiness of the
political forces involved across the spectrum, there is so far no recognizable
and avowedly Utopian environmentalist movement, and therefore no sense of where
the world ought to be driven. This is not to say that there are not examples of
green Utopianism, historical and contemporary, literary and actual: they are
many and various. But they are not yet recognized as an historical movement in
the way that Utopianism in general is, and they have not been granted the
importance to environmentalism that Jameson grants his "sparks" in the
historical pursuit of the Left's aims. At least in literary terms, the studies
bringing these isolated actions into a movement have not yet been done.

It is beyond the scope of this or any single paper to trace in full what I am
calling the "ecotopian imagination." But in beginning to approach the topic as
it appears in American fiction, it will first be necessary to theoretically
develop the term itself, however briefly, and test its usefulness in a
condensed case study. I will use this space to begin both of these tasks.
First, I will ask what kind of reading practices the task requires, briefly
discussing further Fredric Jameson's meditations on Utopianism in
*Archaeologies of the Future* in relation to the recent surface reading
movement. I will then take the developing paradigm as an occasion to read two
related moments in two Willa Cather novels, asking how different imaginative
constructions of similar spaces reveal the presence of speculative ecological
thinking the novels' broader thematic apparatuses.

<br>

Walter Benjamin tells us in his "Theses on the Philosophy of History" that to
make an historical articulation of the past "means to seize hold of a memory as
it flashes up at a moment of danger"---for such an image of the past
"only...flashes up at the instant when it can be recognized" (255). In moments
such as this, when a globalized system of production has rearranged the pieces
of the world and disrupted most regional ecosystems, images of enclosed systems
are particularly recognizable as environmentally useful paradigms. Jameson
identifies such images as fundamental to Utopianism. He defines "totality" as
"precisely this combination of closure and system, in the name of autonomy and
self-sufficiency" and says that such totality can be "ultimately the source
of...otherness or radical, even alien, difference" (5). From an environmental
perspective, this framing of Utopianism is quite appealing. In the first place,
the closed system has been an important aspect of ecological thought since
ecological thought existed. Whether in the form of Darwin's discoveries in the
Galapagos, the Biosphere 2 lab in Arizona, or "Spaceship Earth" as an early
paradigm of sustainability in U.S. political discourse, the concept recurs in
many different forms. 

It remains to be seen what the Utopian version of this closure brings to
ecological analysis that ecological analysis does not already have. The
emphasis on autonomy and self-sufficiency offers the beginnings of an answer:
these concepts forge a link between the closed ecological system and historical
instances of separation and autonomy, letting one ask how ecological factors
might interact with concepts of the nation state and sovereignty. Emphasizing
"difference" as a feature of Utopian totality may also let us draw lines
between the evolutionary processes of differentiation, ecological diversity,
and difference in the sense of culture and identity. In many cases, ecological
differentiation tends to go hand in hand with other forms of difference:
sexual, national, economic, and "cultural" more broadly.

Pursuing these questions in the study of literature requires a particular type
of reading, for which we have the pieces but not the full assemblage. For the
type of reading the ecotopian imagination requires, we must reconcile Fredric
Jameson's Utopian analysis, based implicitly on the "hermeneutics of
suspicion," and a persuasive contemporary challenge to the hermeneutics of
suspicion in "surface reading."[^surface] From the former I will accept the
possibility that the speculative construction of space can be understood as a
result of wish fulfillment and a complex response to ideological determinants.
I will emulate the latter in focusing on what these novels put in plain
sight---by taking as seriously as possible the worlds the novels construct,
separating them from interpretation where possible, and asking how those worlds
work in the most material sense possible. The latter method will resemble a
literary historical materialism that confines itself to the universe of a text
in some cases, but that in other cases draws lines between the social-material
world of the author and the world she constructs in response to it.

In asking what using the ecotopian imagination as a basis of inquiry can show
us about a text, then, we must pose several pointed questions. First, where is
the closed system in question, and in what conditions does it arise? Second,
what unique characteristics can we detect in the material conditions of this
closed system---its ecology, spatial characteristics, built environment---and
what can this *reading for material* tell us about the social structures those
material traces enable? And finally, how do the material aspects of this unique
space contribute to the thematic apparatus of the text? This last point can be
further specified to emphasize situations in which difference of any sort,
perhaps especially sexual difference and cultural "contact zones," comes into
play. 

<br>

Willa Cather's novel *The Professor's House* (the "Tom Outland's Story" section
specifically) offers an excellent starting point for this analysis, as it is
the first of two sequential Cather novels that offers ecotopian presentations
of a very similar space, cliff cities in differing states of ruin. While the
cliff city in *Death Comes for the Archbishop* was built by Ácoma, the city in
*The Professor's House* was the home of a long-dead and unknown tribe; this
detail is important for reasons that will be discussed, but the narrative
purpose of the spaces is quite similar. 

When Tom Outland discovers the cliff city, he is unwittingly searching for a
space that makes "home" attainable, and thus the cliff city itself offers him
an alternative domicile, functioning differently from the "home" in a more
traditional American sense. Tom , an orphaned young man working as a cowboy
when the story takes place, is tending a herd with a friend, Roddy, when he
spots it. Most critics agree that Tom and Roddy have a heterosocial
relationship with strong romantic overtones, but this romance only expresses
itself in the alternative family unit Tom and Roddy establish with their
assistant and temporary housekeeper, Henry. At the time the Ácoma cliff city is
discovered, the three of them have established routines of masculine
housekeeping that forms a strong counterpoint with the traditional,
heterosexual forms of housekeeping that dominate the novel's narration and
thematic arc.[^housekeeping] By the time Tom is able to enter the cliff city,
these men have already formed a kind of Utopian enclave of their own: none of
them has been able to exist to their comfort in the heterosexual, capitalist
form of the home; all are on the run from the dominant culture of the *oikos*
in one sense or another. I use the term *oikos* to denote the intersection of
the "home," *oikos*'s literal translation from the Greek, and economy and
ecology, which have *oikos* in their etymological root (oiko-nomia and
oiko-logia). This temporary Utopian space of the cabin, however, is defined by
impermanence, and it is understood that all of them will have to move on soon
to a situation where their difference will again cause them to be ostracized.
It is important to elaborate in detail the moment they encounter the cliff
city, because any Utopian construct, as Jameson shows elsewhere, arises as a
complex response that exceeds the possibilities of its moment.[^utopian-moment] 

What Tom connects with so strongly in the cliff city---and, I suggest, *reads
into* the physical traces of the cliff city---is the elements that make it
self-sustaining and, therefore, socially and politically autonomous. The
details he picks out emphasize the conditions necessary for autonomy, and his
interpretation of them shows that his perception is colored by the difference
in his own identity from that accepted by the dominant culture of the *oikos*.
As a result of his vulnerability, the bulk of the details he picks out place
emphasis on the natural protections offered by the cliff city's location. He
offers a litany of evidence for the cleanliness and absolute lack of "disorder"
in the cliff city: "everything seemed open and clean," he says, and almost
every stone surface that is described has been "smoothly polished" and remains
so (206, 211). Every implication is that an area with fewer natural protections
would in some way have degraded, but that the very features that kept the cliff
city self-sustaining and autonomous for its inhabitants has also allowed it to
remain so for the duration between their departure and Tom's arrival.
Cleanliness due to what Tom calls nature's alternative "housekeep[ing]" becomes
a physical marker of the natural protections offered by the cliff city (206).
For a novel intimately concerned with history, housekeeping, and personal
autonomy, this is an important association.

Of more immediate concern are the traces of sustainable infrastructure that
allow Tom's imagination to pivot from the purely descriptive spatial
imagination to the more obviously Utopian social imagination. Tom gives a great
deal of attention to the presence of a cold spring, and later an
archaeologically minded priest (probably an anticipation of Latour from *Death
Comes for the Archbishop*) points out the presence of granaries (217).  It is
finally revealed that the inhabitants of this cliff city kept their farms and
their home separate, practicing agriculture and hunting in the plains beyond
the city and stockpiling grain to be as self-sufficient as possible (216-20).
The final detail and the one most distinctly held up for emulation is that this
agricultural model of external growth and internal stockpiling allows the
independent development of cultural and social forms, developments that have no
external influence or determinant. Father Dûchene describes the former
inhabitants, based on the same traces Tom and Roddy have seen, as "cut off here
without influence of example or emulation, with no incentive but some natural
yearning for order and security," contrasting them with an earlier description
of other civilizations as murderous and bloodthirsty. Everything that Tom's
recollection includes about the physical space points to the link between the
agricultural system and the autonomous cultural unit it enables in the cliff
city. What he needs out of this space is protection and the ability to develop
his own way of being in the world, and he creates the conditions to satisfy
this need in his interpretation of the physical space and its agricultural
support system.

But ultimately, for the purposes of the *novel* (if such can be separated from
Tom's own needs as a character), the space provides an opportunity to invent
conditions under which alternative forms of domestic labor could exist. The
agricultural system that supports the cliff cities provides different labor
conditions than those more characteristic of the rest of Tom's world, enabling
the development of the cliff city's alternative social system. Agricultural
production for the sake of stockpiling implies a seasonal division of different
types of labor, with the society's resources put to the task of sowing and
harvesting for part of the year and devoted to communal "housekeeping" and
leisure for the rest of it. The non-agricultural part of the year appears to
lead to novel social formations: Tom finds evidence of a communal kitchen,
which is a recurring theme in the minds of Utopian domestic labor reformers
like Charlotte Perkins Gilman; in addition, the description of individual
domiciles stacked like a "beehive" implies a greater degree of communal
existence and shared space than that which defines the American home. 

To summarize, while Tom's own ecotopian imagination merely emphasizes autonomy,
separation, and protection in his interpretation of the cliff city's physical
remains, Cather uses the social inventiveness the space enables in pursuing her
novel's larger theme of domestic labor. The essential aspect of the ecotopian
imagination revealed in Cather's case is that imagining novel social forms
necessitates speculation on the material conditions in which they would arise:
the hazily defined community relies on the specific agricultural system of the
cliff city. 

<br>

A very similar relationship exists between the agricultural model and physical
space in the Ácoma cliff city of *Death Comes for the Archbishop*, and many of
the same physical traces return. But because the space exists in a complex
middle ground between the human desires of Father Latour, a very different
character from Tom, and the thematic requirements of a novel with very
different aims, the spatial imaginary is notably different. 

Many of the defining features of this spatial-economic dyad return in *Bishop*.
The Ácoma share the same division of interior and exterior space, with physical
needs satisfied by agriculture and hunting beyond the walls of the cliff city
and the city itself standing as a zone of safety and culture. The
interpretation of them, however, has changed significantly. Everything that
Father Latour sees is cast in a religious light: mesas are "generally Gothic in
outline, resembling vast cathedrals"; Earth and heaven become coextensive in
the site of the mesas, which are "inconceivable without their attendant clouds,
which were part of them, as the smoke is part of the censer"; the safety of the
perch is glossed as "Sanctuary!" (94,95,97). The spatial imagination---not to
say that it is precisely ecotopian in these instances alone---shows its brush
strokes, dabbing religious significance over the city and its setting in what
is clearly Latour's own perspective.

Descriptions which we might rightly attribute to Latour are hardly the only
sites of religious re-casting, however. The narrative construction of physical
space---and perhaps most important, the narration *of* the space's
construction---likewise accounts for the different narrative requirements
placed on the setting. The architectural corollary to a watchtower of *The
Professor's House* is part of a church in the crumbling Ácoma mission, adding
spiritual redemption to physical protection. Reading this structure is somewhat
complicated by the knowledge that the Ácoma mission is an actually existing
site, and not the result solely of narrative construction. But there is room to
trace Cather's spatial invention the margins of the actual space: with
"deep-worn paths...washed white and clean" like the hallmarks of the cliff city
in *Professor*, she leads us again to "cisterns...full of fresh rain water"
that allow, in combination with "a secret spring below," human life to thrive
where the only other life is poisonous nightshade (98-9). Sustaining
infrastructure again leads to absolute separation, autonomy, and the
maintenance of difference to a greater degree than would otherwise be possible.
But unlike in *Professor*, absolute separation is as strangling as partial
separation is nourishing.  Latour learns that another nearby village with
similar spatial characteristics "perished from hunger" when their lone
"stairway...was broken off by a great storm many centuries ago" (96). The
danger of absolute autonomy is set next to its cultural necessity, a reality
similar meditations in *Professor* do not recognize.

The reason for this middle state between absolute separation and uncomplicated
intercourse with the rest of the world is clarified by context: the space is an
occasion for meditation on the role of the closed system in ecological,
historical, and spiritual terms, each of which perspectives is essential to the
novel to a varying degree. Indeed, these perspectives can be said to come
together, even come to conflict, in the depiction of the Ácoma city. Latour's
journey is ultimately a religious mission, a pursuit of spiritual change and
cultural erasure. Among the thematic tensions of the novel is the contradiction
between a religious perspective of necessary salvation and consciousness of
historical conquest---all combined with a sensitivity to difference in his
interactions with the half-converted indigenous people of New Mexico. While it
is unclear to what extent Latour himself is conscious of this goal, Cather sets
up Latour's character arc as the earnest pursuit of his religious mission while
trying not to replicate the sins of historical conquest. 

This careful balance finds expression in an historical and ecological reading
of the space and its many layers by Latour himself. While he takes a certain
amount of pleasure in the ruins of an "enclosed garden" in the mission's
cloisters, he likewise recognizes that they only exist because of conquest:
"The rock of Ácoma had never been taken by a foe but once,---by Spaniards in
armour" (102, 97). This conflict comes to bear directly on the question of the
closed system.  On one hand, Latour recognizes the homology between the
autonomous religious culture of the Ácoma and "the Hebrews of the Old
Testament, always being carried captive into foreign lands,---their rock was an
idea of God, the only thing their conquerors could not take from them" (97). By
drawing the comparison, he implicitly grants the Ácoma's unredeemed culture
dignity within a Judeo-Christian system of valuation. On the other hand, he (if
not Cather) stops just short of realizing that the same path forged by a
predecessor, Father Ramirez, causes the subjugated Ácomas to carry raw
materials from far and wide to build the mission, ultimately violating its
cultural and ecological autonomy. The physical space itself becomes a medium
for the elaboration of this conflict.

Its resolution, though, is finally ecological. The wasted traces of a
once-verdant cloister garden indicate the faded presence of conquest, the
uneasy peace established between religious incursion and cultural autonomy.
When an overreaching, overtly despotic priest, Fray Baltazar, is violently
removed from his command at the head of the Ácoma mission, Cather emphasizes a
change in the ecological regime: "The women took pleasure in watching the
garden pine and waste away from thirst...the whitening foliage of the peach
trees, and the green grapes shriveling on the vines" (114). The land is
returned to the ecological state Latour simultaneously admires and fears: the
barrenness in which the only hardy plant is datura. The solution to the problem
of cultural mixing without conquest is a priest "who was well satisfied with
beans and jerked meat, and let the pueblo turkey flock scratch in the hot dust
that had once been Baltazar's garden" (114). Violations of ecological autonomy
become both a figure and a material part of historical and spiritual conquest,
and the closed system is an essential figure for Cather in pointing out the
mutual determinacy of these strains of history.

<br>

In two consecutive readings of a similar space, subtle changes to the material
base of the ecology and conditions of production lead to the speculative
construction of drastically different social formations. Mediating these
differences are the thematic needs of the novel and the perspective offered by
the characters in question---a process of mediation that underscores the
ultimately Utopian nature of these constructions in the sense Jameson lays out
in *Archaeologies of the Future*. Together, they form an image of a powerful
desire for autonomous cultural creativity and the spaces that enable it.

These two examples of the ecotopian imagination should make clear that the
purpose of the interpretive method is not to *solve* the problems of the
current historical and ecological moment with visions from the past, a trap
that Benjamin tries to help us transcend. Rather, it is to incorporate the
analysis of ecotopian structures into analysis of cultural, ecological, and
literary history: to trace the path of Jameson's "comet" by the "sparks" it
emits, and to know more about both comet and spark as a result. This analysis
has provided two examples in which the full significance of a socio-spatial
image cannot be understood without some investigation of the ecological
base---the agricultural methods and physical structures that give rise to
social systems and the built environment. In choosing such similar images in
works by a single author, I hope that I have sufficiently demonstrated the
complex mutual determination between the material traces scattered across such
images and the way those images interact with the larger thematic apparatuses
of the novels in which they appear. Above all, I hope I have demonstrated that
material traces can usefully be read in a novel's setting---thereby pointing
the way for a new type of ecological "surface reading" that can usefully
complicate existing Utopian reading methods.

[^surface]: Sharon Marcus and Stephen Best "take surface to mean what is
evident, perceptible, apprehensible in texts; what is neither hidden nor
hiding; what, in the geometrical sense, has length and breadth but no
thickness, and therefore covers no depth. A surface is what insists on being
looked at rather than what we must train ourselves to see through" (9).

[^housekeeping]: I will try not to spend too much time discussing this
housekeeping *per se*, as I have already written on the topic at length in a
paper I turned in to Prof. Graham last year. Suffice it to say there is a lot
more to this housekeeping than meets the eye. 

[^utopian-moment]: E.g.: "the Utopian remedy must at first be a fundamentally
negative one, and stand as a clarion call to remove and to extirpate this
specific root of all evil from which all the others spring" (12).
