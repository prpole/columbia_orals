Given that the environmental justice movement has arisen in part because of the
shortcomings of its forebears, this pairing of themes has the potential to be
somewhat volatile. I take "environmental justice" to mean the recognition that
environmentalism must proceed hand in hand with social justice movements;
implicit in this definition is also the recognition that it has *not* always
done so. By reading these core texts in such close proximity to a more recent
flourishing of environmental thinking, then, I will necessarily be tracing some
definitional tensions of the environmental humanities as a discipline: what
Lawrence Buell elsewhere calls "first-wave" and "second-wave ecocriticism,"
ecocentrism and anthropocentrism, full-belly environmentalism and the
environmentalism of the poor, Americanist ecocriticism and postcolonial
ecocriticism. The list could continue, but the theme that motivates it would be
the same, and it can be broadly glossed as the demand by many more recent
ecocritics for a greater degree of intersection between environmental and
social activism.

Two texts in particularly direct conflict are Joni Adamson's *American Indian
Literature, Environmental Justice, and Ecocriticism* (2001) and Leo Marx's *The
Machine in the Garden* (1964), which would seem to be making very similar
arguments in some senses were they not so diametrically opposed in others.
Their core motivating concepts share a similar structure: Marx calls his
alternately "the middle landscape" or "the middle state" and Adamson calls hers
"the middle place." For Marx, the "middle landscape" is primarily a (largely
symbolic) resolution between nature and culture---which can either mean nature
and art, nature and technological intervention, or wilderness and control. For
Adamson, the "middle place" is a state of equilibrium between respecting and
using nature, but it is also a reconciliation between *cultures* that predicate
themselves on exploiting or respecting their environment. In the most general
sense, both authors' refer to a compromise between the opposed structures of
Prometheanism and preservation of nature. 

Nevertheless, a silence exists between the two. Besides Marx's text preceding
Adamson's by some forty years, his side of the silence comes from his system's
inability to account for the most foundational concerns of environmental
justice. The poles of his motivating tension are between the Promethean impulse
and the preservative impulse *among wealthy European men*, whose will
(whichever pole wins out) will be imposed upon a landscape that they understand
as empty despite existing peoples and cultures. Framed this way, one is able to
see that the concerns of environmental justice are demarcated precisely by what
Leo Marx's schema proscribes.

This orientation's apparent paucity from an environmental justice perspective
may provide the context for Adamson's side of the mutual silence: for despite
the renown of Marx's classic text and its best-known concept, the "middle
landscape" does not get so much as a footnote or index entry in Adamson's
development of a concept to which it would seem at least relevant, if only
contrapuntally. Expressing Adamson's concept in terms of Marx's earlier one, it
could be said that a *real* middle landscape is found in the ecological and
cultural ethics of the American Indian populations whom Marx renders invisible,
in which the human-altered landscape can be admitted as "nature." By rendering
that more complicated and multifarious version of a "landscape," Adamson
establishes a literal grounds for the overlapping social and environmental
concerns that motivate her book.

Adamson and Marx make such a good representative conflict, then, because their
similarities only make their differences more bitterly felt. As with many other
factions of the capital-L-Left, these would-be allies find their points of
confluence blotted out by overwhelming difference. This is not to say that it
should be otherwise, for the fundamental disagreement comes not out of
doctrinal quibbles but a more complex social consciousness in the movement as a
whole. In other words, one might think of environmental justice's conflicted
relationship to its forebears in terms of Walter Benjamin's well known
statement that "there is no document of civilization that is not at the same
time a document of barbarism," had Benjamin been referring more specifically to
environmentalism. The way out of this history of barbarism, to the ecocritic
who shares these concerns, is to correct the obfuscation of injustice by prior
environmentalisms and prevent it in those of the future by incorporating more
voices from more various communities. The inherent contradictions in social and
environmental activism promise that this task will continue being difficult,
even if we're slightly more optimistic than the inevitability of "barbarism"
that Benjamin's statment implies.

It is tempting to allow this "first- and second-wave ecocriticism" dyad to
stand, uncomplicated, as a factor of time exclusively. But the publication of
*Silent Spring* in 1962, two years prior to *The Machine the Garden*, makes
such a simple trajectory much more difficult---not because *Silent Spring* is
itself committed to resolving the problematic silences of the environmental
movement on race and inequality, but because its own brand of anti-corporate
environmental justice laid the groundwork for a more robust understanding of
environmental racism that would come to fruition a generation later. Carson's
concern can be framed as a pursuit of the "Promethean" tendencies of American
culture from another angle, but in a materialist sense, not in the strictly
intellectual one that Leo Marx pursues. Rather, she exposes the dangers
inherent in the chemical alterations that enable the twentieth-century American
understanding of comfort. This technologically enabled comfort is based
implicitly on Prometheanism, with all the progressive narratives that implies,
and yet it poisons those that benefit from it. Carson's rhetorical strategy
relies on the ubiquity of what she observes, and indeed her success in
demonstrating that ubiquity can be measured by the continued popularity of the
book. But in a subtle way, this strategy also obscures the differential risk
from toxins to which minority racial groups are subject. As both Joni Adamson
and Carolyn Merchant discuss, the United Church of Christ's Commission for
Racial Justice in 1987 would disclose the highly differentiated nature of risk
from environmental toxins in their influential report, a major step in
establishing the concept of environmental racism. So while Carson's reticence
on social and racial disparities cannot be credited with establishing this
concept, the foundation of environmental health activism that she set in motion
was nevertheless a necessary precursor to it.

Besides unwittingly laying the groundwork for environmental-racism activism,
one of *Silent Spring*'s major contributions to midcentury environmentalism was
its focus on activism that was, broadly, as much social as it was strictly
environmental---which could certainly not be said of Leo Marx, who maintains a
strictly analytical stance throughout, nor other environmental writers whose
ethics too often seem to extend *only* to the land. Carson inaugurates a
visibility-based environmental activism that anticipates some of what Rob Nixon
has recently developed in his *Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the
Poor* (2011). The invisibility of what Carson describes accounts for much of
the rhetorical effect of her description, as she plays the toxins (which are
themselves "unspectacular" forms of violence in Nixon's terms) against the more
"spectacular," gruesome results. While he does not specifically address this
rhetorical juxtaposition, he does theorize the place of visibility in
environmental activism by urging new strategies on the part of environmental
activists to keep up with the channel-changing attention spans of contemporary
news cycles and their consumers. Both authors, then, unite social activism and
environmental activism through visibility. It is thus fitting that Nixon takes
Carson as a subject of his discussion, even though it is in the context more of
"ad feminam" attacks and gender-based silencing than as a precursor to his own
method.

The other "core" text, Carolyn Merchant's *Radical Ecology* (1992), is a
turning point in my list, as it introduces a *genre* that is very prevalent in
the environmental humanities as well as a conceptual framework that can be used
to begin organizing many of the conversations within the discipline. The genre
it inaugurates is the "state of the field" book, which is a form that many
works in the past two decades seem to take: Lawrence Buell, Ramachandra Guha
and Joan Martinez-Alier offer two more examples between them. The prevalence of
this form is telling in itself, as it indicates a high degree of variation
within the field, of an intensity that can be measured by the conceptual
distance between subfields. That a new overview seems to be required every
half-decade or so also indicates the rapid change occurring in activist and
scholarly movements alike. Not just the form itself, but the sections that make
up this particular example of it are telling: Merchant exhibits a trend common
to overviews of the environmental humanities, in which intellectual paradigms
and activist movements are put in close proximity and begin, to a certain
extent, to blend. Just as she is compelled to outline several ethical paradigms
or variations on deep ecology, Merchant gives a brief history of activist
movements, their intellectual commitments, and their status at the time of
writing. The activist stance Rachel Carson represents (again, in contrast to
more removed analysis) is taken further by this common trope, in which the
scholar links academic work with in-the-trenches activism, putting the two
tasks in a common lineage.

Finally, the importance of Merchant's gesture to include environmental
activists of many stripes among a more academic overview goes further still in
Ramachandra Guha and Joan Martinez-Alier's *Varieties of Environmentalism*. The
collection of essays is somewhat difficult to characterize in the sense that it
encompasses work by two prolific authors on themes that hold together only
loosely---but it is possible to extract two related concepts from it as
representatives, the "environmentalism of the poor" and "vocabularies of
protest." The two concepts are related: the latter is an elaboration of
culturally and historically situated forms of protest that comprise both a set
of values (articulated or not) and a set of strategies for exercising those
values; the former is an umbrella term for a set of economic and cultural
situations that share common elements in their "vocabularies." To Guha and
Martinez-Alier, the ecological economist attempting to place a monetary value
on future goods is in the same lineage as indigenous "pluck-and-plant"
movements in Karnataka, India, in which populations dependent on an ecological
commons "plucked" nutrient-sapping eucalyptus trees in order to "plant" more
soil- and community-sustaining plants in their stead. Both groups are
exercising a certain "vocabulary of protest" that is dependent on their own
situated perspective and the goals they pursue as a result. 

The tensions between environmental justice and earlier environmentalisms can be
understood thematically rather than temporally. While Leo Marx's analysis may
be a function of being a practicing intellectual historian in the sixties, the
important point of differentiation is the methodology that allows no clear
route to praxis. It may be this aspect of his work that keeps him out of the
indices of many recent works while *Silent Spring* continues to be discussed
more regularly. Other recent work has begun productively engaging the more
problematic forebears in an effort, spoken or no, to bridge this gap and figure
out how the older work can be approached now: Rob Nixon's discussion of Edward
Abbey in *Slow Violence* is one example. It is not a tension that is going
anywhere anytime soon, so that kind of work is likely to continue.
