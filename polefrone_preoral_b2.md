###Introduction

If our only sources were political novelists like Frank Norris, Charlotte
Perkins Gilman, and Henry Roth, we might reasonably conclude that to live
between the turn of the century and the Depression was to be forever engaged in
a frantic, claustrophobic search for the lost frontier. Norris's McTeague
bursts out of a world crowded with drawing rooms, in which "nature is cosey,
intimate, small, and homelike, like a good-natured housewife," and arrives
doggedly in a land where the "entire region is untamed...a vast, unconquered
brute of the Philocene epoch, savage, sullen, and magnificently indifferent to
men" (209). In a neat, perhaps deliberate inversion some fifteen years later,
Gilman creates another kind of frontier entirely for her male protagonists.  In
hers, the "savage" wilderness is replaced with precisely the "small,"
"homelike" natural world in which a combination of natural impediments and
intentional population control prevent the all-female society from growing
beyond a certain scale or population. Commitment to or rejection of
expansionism is reflected in the conception of space itself, and more
specifically in how human communities interact with their natural environments.

And yet whatever these two examples might suggest, the presence of something
resembling "nature" or wilderness need not always define the search for the
frontier, especially in high-density urban environments where "nature" can be
hard to identify. As a concept, "the frontier" is just as active in driving the
endless waves of immigrants landing in the densely packed apartment blocks of
Henry Roth's New York City in 1907 as it is in driving McTeague into the wilds
of California. The geographical frontier was lost long before they
arrived---declared dead in the preamble to the 1890 census (Turner 199). But
despite the utter absence of its natural and geographic instantiations, the
frontier exists for Roth's immigrants as a necessary commitment to adapt their
existing social formations, causing those formations to mediate between
traditional cultural identities and the alien material conditions.

Population density, and the concomitant changes in the material conditions of
sustenance and production, define the difference between the frontier as it
exists in the work of these three authors. In all of the novels I will discuss,
the actual or conceptual frontier gives rise to an *act of imaginative social
invention* on the part of the characters or the author. But as density
increases from Norris's work to Gilman's to Roth's, I will show, these new
formations become less attainable in material life, reflecting a decrease in
political agency.Density, then, finally determines the amount of agency granted
to the speculative mode of political creativity that the presence of a frontier
tends to inspire.

On one pole, Norris's *McTeague* and *The Octopus* depict the search for the
lost frontier by those whose spatial imagination is defined by the existence of
areas of low population density. His American-born rural workers keep the
American West and its ethos alive, although not necessarily stable, for a time
, but their community structure is finally dismantled by the intervention of a
global system designed to benefit areas of high density. On the other pole is
Henry Roth's *Call It Sleep*, in which the only choices presented by what we
might call the "full frontier" of maximum density are one of two dominant
cultures: assimilation to American culture or identification with an enclave of
traditional immigrant culture. Gilman presents a middle way. By suspending
historical increases in density, and thus the frontier, her narrative creates
conditions in which the dominant culture is subject to a constant process of
inventive refinement without engaging in capitalist forms of unrestrained
growth. Nevertheless, it compromises political agency in the extent to which
this totalizing (if flexible) dominant culture makes dissensus impossible.

### Materiality and Social Formation in the Frontier Thesis

Why link density with the frontier, though, and how is it possible that the
frontier would have just as much to do with an urban setting as a rural one?
Density's association with the frontier is in part the remnant of a bygone
geographical measurement, but its cultural significance was established by
Frederick Jackson Turner's influential discussion of the frontier's *end*.
Geographically, the frontier is the "margin" of a settlement and an area with
two inhabitants or fewer per square mile (US Census Bureau, Turner 199). But to
Turner, the frontier "is the outer edge of the wave---the meeting point between
savagery and civilization," less a matter of figures than of valuation (200). 

In establishing a basis of this valuation, he draws an important link between
the frontier mentality and density itself:

> The American frontier is sharply distinguished from the European frontier---a
fortified boundary line running through dense populations. The most significant
thing about the American frontier is, that it lies at the hither edge of free
land. (200)

What Turner calls the "hither edge of free land" we must, in 2016, rephrase as
the "hither edge of seizable land," but the distinction can nevertheless be
useful. The relative density of contiguous areas gives rise to entirely
distinct cultural forms. The European frontier is an imaginary line drawn based
on political structures and national boundaries. The American frontier is
defined by the social and cultural tendencies determined by encounters with a
more material difference in land use.

This material determination of social forms by density is too complex to be
called mechanistic---a textbook definition of overdetermination---but to
Turner's mind it exhibits a clear trend in which the old-world and new-world
material base give rise to drastically different types of development. The
version of social development that occurs in situations of high density
includes the "evolution of institutions...such as the rise of representative
government; the differentiation of simple colonial governments into complex
organs; the progress from primitive industrial society, without division of
labor, up to manufacturing civilization" (200). European, high-density
development takes the form of increasing complexity because expansion is
impossible. 

This description has interesting (if, perhaps, unintended) resonances with a
Marxist base-superstructure theory of historical development, in which changes
to the "real foundation" of a given society correspond to changes in the "legal
and political superstructure...to which correspond definite forms of social
consciousness" (qtd. in Williams 75). Turner's major contribution in this light
is to add population density as a major determinant in frontier contexts, but
it is hardly a single determining variable.  Conditions of high density rely
not only on the material conditions of production and distribution. They also
rely on the foundation of all material relations, the conditions of the soil in
an ever-changing landscape (or the means to import the fruits of such soil from
elsewhere).[^soil] Therefore, the European form of
development-as-increasing-complexity *has* to take into consideration the
conditions that enable it. For every high-density form of society, there is a
division of labor that goes beyond its bounds, whether it is the "country"
immediately beyond the "city" or someone else's country, coopted for the
sustenance of cities far away.[^world-ecology] The division of labor as an
ecological mediator between high- and low-density populations will become
important when discussing the frontier in the eyes of soil-conscious novelists
like Norris and Gilman.

The endless expanse of "country" in America, so long as it existed, allowed for
continual development by expansion simultaneous with development by increasing
complexity. As the frontier continues to move outwards, Turner suggests, we
witness in what *was* the American frontier a "recurrence of the process of
evolution in each western area reached in the process of expansion," or in
other words, a shift from the limitless (American) paradigm of the frontier to
the dense and limited (European) paradigm (200). Here, then, is the real loss
of the frontier---not the loss of density *per se*, as the quantitative
thinking of the census bureau might have us believe. The movement of the
American frontier is a situation of changing density, but the *loss* of the
frontier results from a shifting dialectical relationship between land and
social formations, in which density figures as an essential middle term. 

In the literature, we see a response to this loss. The response takes the form
of attempted reclamation of low density in some form or another, which is
always impossible in the final analysis. But the form these responses take
bears a clear relation to the relevant conditions of density in which the
attempted reclamation occurs.

### Community Without Density on the Vanishing Frontier

In Norris's novels, areas of low density are Utopian spaces representing a
freedom to live as one wants, far out of reach of modernity's rules and
cultural restrictions. Communities of miners give McTeague an alternative
social structure to the dominant "civilized" culture of the city, and in these
spaces he finds peace in unrestrained violence. Subsequently, *The Octopus*
dramatizes the loss of the communal autonomy McTeague revels in: Presley and
the rural farmers idealize their autonomy and political creativity, but are
unable to save it from the logic of expansion as the "country" and its social
forms are subsumed to the needs of the city. In other words, high-density
subsumes low-density in the expanding division of labor. Both associate the
gradient of low-to-high density as a gradient of individual political and
social agency.

It is strange to say that McTeague finds his fullest expression in the very
environment that kills him (it is the expanse of unsettled desert land that
makes his rescue impossible), but his own response to the landscape leaves no
room for doubt. The novel's final section begins with the flight from
high-density, settled urbanity to the low-density frontier in which McTeague's
brutish, uncivilized nature finds the last shreds of the environment in which
it is able to be viable. We must say "last shreds" because the fragility of the
frontier is painfully clear: Iowa Hill, McTeague's first frontier destination,
is a "one-street town" that was once "on the summit of a mountain, but the
sides of this mountain have long since been 'hydraulicked' away, so that the
town now clings to a mere back bone" (209). The environment on which McTeague's
full self-expression relies is being stripped for the raw materials
high-density development requires---with special emphasis put on the industrial
means of production with "hydraulicked," a word emphasizing the complexity and
scale of the operation. 

McTeague in part identifies with the land itself, but also the communal
structures that arise from it. When he finds "a resemblance between his present
work [as a miner] and the profession he had been forced to abandon," he is
really recognizing his attempt to maintain a low-density identity in a
high-density environment. He is also recalling that he "had been forced to
abandon" dentistry because of the complex social structures density
necessitates: where he was able to simply *do* dentistry in his frontier
apprenticeship, legal strictures force him to discontinue his practice in the
city. Everything in these marginal frontier zones works according to the laws
of the American West in which he was raised, an environment that instilled in
him a set of values and proclivities that are unable to withstand the
"domesticated" culture of high-density environments. The fundamental
proposition of base and superstructure that Raymond Williams identifies
somewhat dubiously, "that social being determines consciousness," is true in
Norris's universe, but it can be specified as Williams demands: conditions of
density determine social being, which in turn determines consciousness
(Williams 75).

McTeague moves from high density to low, and thereby regains (however briefly)
the agency to live in a social structure from which he is not estranged; the
more historically representative narrative of *The Octopus* depicts the loss of
low-density community structures in the face of the dominant culture of
density. In *The Octopus*, the more affirming social relations of low-density
localism---the individual ranch, the community of farmers, the
commonwealth---are destroyed by the margin's incorporation into a larger
division of labor, which is determined and controlled by areas of greater
density. As a modern agricultural system is being built, its beneficiaries
violently establish a flow of material energy in the form of nutrients, with
tons of wheat flowing from the low-density communities of farmers (the San
Joaquin valley) to the high-density urban communities around them. The
narrative maps to the life cycle of a single crop of wheat, from sowing the
seeds to distributing the harvest; but in the process, the product is
appropriated by the forces of capital that are establishing a global
distribution of wheat as a commodity. In the simpler, less developed division
of labor in lower-density communities, the farmer would be responsible for
every step in the process and the energy embodied in the harvest would stay
local to the community. Instead, capital and energy alike both flow to the
higher-density urban areas (represented by Shelgrim and the city council he
keeps in his pocket), destroying the sustaining economic and ecological base of
low-density social structures. 

In the context of this wholesale destruction (or, perhaps, destruction by
wholesale), the "frontier" becomes a concept for resistance. It only exists in
the minds of the farmers who believe that, by voluntary enclosure and by
removing themselves from the global market, they can hold on to their
autonomous communal structures. This in turn requires the invention of new
political and legal structures. But these structures can only become *actual*
rather than merely speculative with the political agency that the low-density
frontier enables---the very agency that, unbeknownst to them, they have lost in
their unwitting incorporation into a global division of labor. The ultimate
defeat of these farmers---the infiltration and destruction of their resistance
movement---becomes coextensive with the final destruction of the frontier in
the Joaquin Valley.

The "frontier" concept appears in this context as the glorification of low
population density, as is most distinctly evident in the cultural production
that attempts to reconstruct the frontier. Presley's largely hypothetical "Epic
of the West," which he abandons when the truth of global markets becomes
inescapable, provides an example within an example of such cultural production.
Arriving in San Joaquin from the highly developed East Coast, he deduces "that
his poem should be of the West, that world's frontier of Romance, where a new
race, a new people---hardy, brave, and passionate---were building an empire"
(7). The frontier, because it is on the cusp of being lost, becomes the
"frontier of Romance." It also becomes predicated on the construction of a new
society by "new people," establishing an outsiders view of the same frontier
society McTeague understands as his true home.

The destruction of Utopian frontier visions like Presleys is clearly correlated
with density. Presley draws power and inspiration from the emptiness of the
frontier, which he takes in from a high perch and imagines himself to have
"dominated the entire country" (34). But this imaginary relation to space is
punctuated by images of agricultural density and the production systems that
enable *human* density. From his high vantage point, he also sees a "mass" of
sheep, "compact, solid, slowly moving...huge without form, like a thick-pressed
growth of mushrooms, spreading out in all directions over the earth" (22). This
mass is obliterated when, finding a seam in a fence, they wander onto the train
tracks and are slaughtered *en masse* by Shelgrim's railroad, a grotesque
version of the image of the train whistle so prevalent in Leo Marx's *The
Machine in the Garden* (35). The vision of density is repeated, with a more
obvious narrative function, later: the farmers engage in a jack-rabbit hunt,
the strategy for which is to drive the jack rabbits out from their individual
existences, mobilize them into a herd, enclose them, and begin the slaughter.
The process is described in detail: "Denser and denser grew the throng. In all
directions nothing was to be seen but the loose mass of the moving jacks....It
was no longer a herd covering the earth. It was a sea, whipped into confusion,
tossing incessantly, leaping, falling, agitated by unseen forces" (343). This
situation that ends in slaughter prefigures the later gathering of "The League"
of organized farmers, in what seems for a moment to be a prelude to revolution:
rallied into resistance, the farmers march towards the center of San Joaquin,
where "great, tumultuous heavings, like ground-swells of an incoming tide,
surged over and through the multitude" as they are pushed toward the enclosure
of the Opera House (374). When they arrive, a carefully calculated
counter-revolutionary campaign discredits the speakers and disperses the crowd,
symbolically slaughtering the revolutionary ambitions of the crowd. Just as the
increasing density of sheep and jack rabbits leads to their slaughter, the
freedom to live a truly pastoral life in low-density communities is destroyed
by the beneficiaries of density, using literal physical density as a cudgel. 

Every image of density is also an image of loss in Norris's novels: the loss of
frontier communities which are always glorified and which always rely on
political agency, which in turn relies on sparsely populated land. It is
impossible to separate the increase in density from the rise of a globalized
division of labor in a novel that ends with the establishment of a global wheat
market. But Norris does not demonstrate what the creation of community looks
like when carved out of urban density---communal creativity on Turner's
"European" frontier. For that depiction, we have to turn to Henry Roth.

### Immigrants and High-Density Frontier Communities

It is impossible to sustain Turner's absolute differentiation between the
European and the American frontier for long when we recognize that for many
twentieth-century immigrants to America, the conditions that define the
European, high-density "frontier" were mirrored in the high-density urban
environments into which they arrived. In Henry Roth's depiction of urban life
in *Call It Sleep*, the frontier is not threatened and vanishing by a global
system of density, as it is in Norris's novels, nor is it arrested in a Utopian
state of purity as (we shall see) it is in Gilman's. For Roth's
European-American, the frontier is simultaneously always already lost as an
object of desire and paradoxically relocated onto Europe itself. The ultimate
unattainability of the frontier results in reproduction of the European
communities, even those of rural villages, but in the highest-density
conditions imaginable. What they find is a sharply curtailed freedom to create
any new social form that might help mediate between culture and the material
conditions of their lives. Their horizons, rather, are to accept one of two
dominant cultural paradigms in their very full new world: the European
traditions they come from or assimilationist American culture. In either case,
the European-American frontier is of a kind with the high-density European
frontier, even if Turner misses its presence[^turner-europeans] in the American
urban landscape, with all the attendant political constraints. 

In the first case, identification with European traditions, a peculiar
operation occurs in the concept of the "frontier": when America proves to have
lost the frontier in pursuit of which the immigrants arrive, the referent for a
low-density lifestyle paradoxically reverts to the European landscape itself.
One day, David's mother brings home "a picture of a small patch of ground full
of tall green stalks, at the foot of which, tiny blue flowers grew" (169). In
the context of their Lower East Side apartment, such open space is
unimaginable, especially for David, who does not recognize the "tall green
stalks" as corn. His mother has to tell him, "It grows out of the earth, you
know, the sweet corn in the summer---it isn't made by pushcart peddlers" (169).
The cultural loss of both agricultural knowledge and the social formations that
come with it mirrors the loss of the frontier in Norris's narratives, but what
is lost is both the broken promise of America and the forgotten fields of
Europe. As we have seen, the place that enables a more harmonious interplay
between self and environment is always disappearing just before one gets
there---and the form of its disappearance is density. 

The American form of the frontier, then, disappears for European-American
immigrants in its displacement onto an unattainable homeland. In its place is
the European frontier, the "line running through dense populations" that Turner
defines in his frontier thesis. In *Call It Sleep*, this "line" is established
not by national boundaries, but by contiguous spheres of cultural influence in
the areas of highest urban density. The limits of cultural expansion in this
dense environment are established as the cultural loss that occurs when the
boundaries of a cultural enclave are breeched by its members.

Cultural loss takes two forms: assimilation and the threat of destruction. When
David climbs to the roof of his building---a vista from which the entire city
and all of its many cultural enclaves are available to him---he encounters Leo,
a Polish-American Christian whom David finds immediately seductive (296-9). The
artifacts of Leo's cultural difference so enthrall David that he eventually
sells sexual access to his step-cousin for the price of a rosary, the ultimate
act of Jewish cultural abnegation. Density in this case results in an encounter
between cultures, contact that nearly discontinues David's access to his
family's traditional culture. Because this traditional culture is David's
nearest proxy to the space and culture represented in his mother's picture,
assimilation threatens to overwrite low-density culture (the Old World, which
has become for David the frontier image) with high-density culture
(assimilation and cultural melange). 

As with the lost rural communities of Norris's novels, the stirrings of a
global economy cause the loss of the low-density cultural forms. Just outside
the novel's consciousness are the economic forces motivating the increase in
density, as the metropolitan division of labor requires more and more workers
for its sustenance. Immigration forms a globalized version of the reserve army
of labor, a term coined by Engels and picked up by Marx in the first volume of
*Capital* to describe the surplus population maintained by the forces of
capitalism to keep labor costs low (and therefore maintain the production of
surplus value) (Marx 352). The cultural expression of the reserve army of labor
is cultural compression in urban conditions of density. What we see in Roth's
narrative is that cultural agency---the agency to fully assimilate without
consequence, to maintain a cultural identity in new material conditions, or to
create an entirely new form that shares aspects of both---is suppressed by the
inexorable forces of density.[^globalization-dialectic]

### Limited Density, Frozen Frontier: Gilman

Charlotte Perkins Gilman, as she is wont to do, establishes a middle place:
between the attempt to seize the disappearing frontier in low-density
communities and the attempt to cope with the lack of one in high-density urban
settings. Because her Utopian novel dismantles distinctions between human and
non-human nature, the concept of population density has to be understood in
terms of the ecological concept of carrying capacity: the maximum amount of a
given population an ecological niche is able to support, based on the amount of
space, availability of nutrients, and presence of natural predators. In this
light, we can consider the frontier as an infinite expansion of humanity's
niche. But expansionism is not so much an increase in the relevant carrying
capacity as it is a total circumvention of it. Infinite expansion of the global
distribution network makes natural conditions irrelevant as a limit to human
population growth. Understanding this, Gilman re-introduces the ecological
concept of carrying capacity in order to limit the maximum level of density her
Utopian society can attain. By limiting density, she freezes Herland's
development and maintains frontier conditions indefinitely. This frozen
frontier creates a compromise between the unlimited individual freedom of the
endless frontier and the ultimate restriction on social creativity that results
from maximum urban density.

But in order to understand *Herland* as a response to the frontier, we have to
understand the difference in its imaginative response to the frontier when
compared with Norris's and Roth's work. Whereas the density-based, imagined
frontiers in Norris and Roth were visible through analysis of the characters'
spatial imaginations, Gilman's novel is itself an imaginative projection in
complex response to the vanishing frontier. We can see evidence for this point
in the way that Vandyck Jennings, her narrator and eventual Herland convert,
frames his presentation of his Utopian travel narrative. He refuses to locate
Herland "for fear some self-appointed missionaries, or traders, or land-greedy
expansionists, will take it upon themselves to push in" (33). Expansionism is
the fear against which Herland must be protected; we can therefore deduce that
it has not yet been subject to expansionism and exists as an exception. More
directly relevant to Turner's frontier thesis is the reason that Vandyck and
his two friends discover Herland in the first place. They see Herland as an
unexpected exception to the ultimate truth that "there was nothing left to
explore now, only patchwork and filling in" (33). The death of the frontier is
proclaimed due to exactly this situation in the 1890 census bulletin Turner
quotes in his thesis: the single line of unsettled land no longer exists but
has been replaced, to use Gilman's phrasing, with "patchwork and filling in"
between settled lands. Herland is from the beginning established as an
exception to this truth, a final frontier on Earth. 

The men quickly discover, however, that this is hardly Norris's frontier of
jubilant savagery, as is evident from the way the Herlanders treat wildness.
Gilman's re-construction of the frontier rewrites the entire narrative of
expansionist progress, including the premise that increasing expansion and
increasing density lead human civilization from savagery to civilization. Both
density and expansion violate the principle of carrying capacity that is the
basis of Gilman's entire society. The concept is introduced out of necessity,
when a natural disaster shuts the women off from the rest of the world, making
expansion impossible and creating conditions of resource scarcity. Scarcity and
the impossibility of trade mean that population growth will be limited by the
availability of food. The Herlanders demonstrate that their treatment of
non-human nature adheres to these rules in their discussion of other animals:
when asked why they have no horses or llamas, a Herlander replies that they "do
not want them anymore. They took up too much room---we need all our land to
feed our people.  It is such a little country, you know" (75). An expansionist
perspective would cause them to go in search of more land, while a proponent of
increasing density would search for a way to pack the animals in as few
hectares as possible or increase the yield of each animal to allow for more of
everything in less space (compare this with the actual historical development
of agriculture and livestock). Instead, Gilman has chosen conditions in which
the former is impossible and the latter goes against the ethos of the
community. When considering the possibility of density for animals that exists
beyond Herland, the Herlanders become horrified to discover that the urban
domesticated dog, "the friend of man, in the city, was a prisoner" (79). The
dignity of the individual organisms in a system is just as important as its
basic sustenance, and the combination of expansionism and density violates
both. 

The middle way Gilman proposes is only possible, of course, because the same
limitations placed on the rest of the ecology are also extended to humans.
Maintaining zero population growth is easy for Herlanders because conceiving
(or not) is an act of decision at a certain point in a woman's life: they
reproduce parthenogenically and have full control over the process. This is the
point at which the limited freedom of individual and cultural expression is
most relevant, however, as it involves the most fundamental repression of
individual impulses. For Gilman's system to work, a delicate balance of
cultural development is required between managing political agency and
inspiring cultural development. Agency is suppressed in two senses. First,
there can be no excessive individual agency in reproduction, resource
cultivation, or individual industry. Freedom from scarcity is in direct
conflict with freedom of action. Second, there is a unified political stance
without room for rival views---nobody seems to want to leave Herland, despite
two thousand years to mull it over---and no evidence of politics or policy
discussion. But even though agency is suppressed, the culture has been
"refined" through generations of communal input, implying a certain amount of
collective political agency within the boundaries set by consensus. This is the
sense in which reintroducing the concept of carrying capacity and limiting
density creates a middle ground of political agency: a rational-seeming balance
of individuality and collectivity that raises some serious questions about the
need for dissensus in a truly free system.

### Conclusion

The frontier, density, and political agency exist in a complex interplay in
these novels and in the historical development of American modernity. Taken in
concert, these novelists show us that when the geographical frontier
disappeared in its truest sense, it continued to exist as an imaginative
yearning for the ability to create new social structures and exercise
collective and individual political will. The density in which this imaginative
yearning arises determines both its character and the extent to which it can be
enacted on actual spaces in actual practice. 

### Postscript

These conclusions have serious gaps, one of which must be addressed. It is no
coincidence that a hermeneutic principle criticized for its indifference to
history's victims fails to account for non-white literary histories. It hardly
needs to be reiterated (and yet simultaneously needs always to be reiterated)
that the "hither edge of free land" in Turner's thesis had on the other side of
it, not empty space, but societies that fall under the categorization of
"savagery" in his estimation. But also absent from this frontier theory of
literary density are the narratives of the invisible labor force pushing the
frontier forward---a movement that, in Turner's hands, is entirely naturalized
and without mechanism or agent, as though the frontier border were literally
blown forth by the winds of "progress."  For black voices, a different
perspective is required, but perhaps not an entirely new paradigm. For black
communities, there is a more fundamental limitation to political agency, one
that takes effect well before the limitations described in this paper can be
reached.

reproduces them in compressed miniature. These communities in turn both further
the progress of globalization by contributing to its division of labor and make
that globality more visible by sheer concentration of difference.
