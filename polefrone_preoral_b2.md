###Introduction

If our only sources were political novelists like Frank Norris, Charlotte
Perkins Gilman, and Henry Roth, we might reasonably conclude that to live
between the turn of the century and the Depression was to be forever engaged in
a frantic, claustrophobic search for the lost frontier. Norris's McTeague
bursts out of a world crowded with drawing rooms, in which "nature is cosey,
intimate, small, and homelike, like a good-natured housewife," and arrives
doggedly to a land where the "entire region is untamed...a vast, unconquered
brute of the Philocene epoch, savage, sullen, and magnificently indifferent to
men" (209). In a neat, perhaps deliberate inversion some fifteen years later,
Gilman creates a new kind of frontier for her male protagonists. Where the
"savage" wilderness is replaced with precisely the "small," "homelike" natural
world in which a combination of natural impediments and intentional population
control prevent the all-female society from growing beyond a certain scale or
population---and it is implied that this limitation causally prevents that
savagery itself from developing. The commitment to or rejection of expansionism
is reflected in the conception of the space itself, and more specifically how
human communities interact with their natural environments.

And yet whatever these two examples might suggest, the presence of something
resembling "nature" or wilderness need not always define the search for the
frontier. As a conceptual space, it is just as active in driving the endless
wave of immigrants landing in the densely packed and distinctly natureless
apartment blocks of Henry Roth's New York City in 1907. The geographical
frontier was lost long before they arrived---declared dead in the preamble to
the 1890 census (Turner 199). But despite the utter absence of its natural and
geographic instantiations, the frontier exists for Roth's immigrants as a
necessary commitment to adapt their existing social formations in such a way
that they mediate between their existing cultural identity and the alien
material conditions of their new life.

Population density, and the concomitant changes in the material conditions of
sustenance and production, define the difference between the frontier as it
exists in the work of these three authors. In all of their work, the actual or
conceptual frontier gives rise to an *act of imaginative social projection* on
the part of the characters or the narrative itself. But the gradient of density
from Norris's work to Roth's corresponds to the attainability of these new
formations and the speculator's perceived agency in resisting the dominant
culture. Density, then, finally determines the amount of agency granted to the
speculative mode of political creativity that the presence of a frontier tends
to inspire.

On one pole, Norris's *McTeague* and *The Octopus* depict the search for the
lost frontier for those whose spatial imagination is defined by areas of low
population density. His American-born rural workers keep the American West and
its ethos alive, although not necessarily stable, until their community
structure is dismantled by the intervention of a global system based on (and
reliant on) density. On the other pole is Henry Roth's *Call It Sleep*, in
which the only choices presented by what we might call the "full frontier" are
one of two dominant cultures: assimilation to American culture or
identification with an enclave of immigrant culture. The attempt to inhabit
density without such acquiescence is nearly suicidal for individual and
community alike. Gilman presents a middle way. By suspending density, and thus
the frontier, in a fixed state, her narrative creates conditions in which the
dominant culture is subject to a constant process of inventive refinement
without engaging in capitalist forms of unrestrained growth. Nevertheless, it
is a compromise of political agency in the extent to which this totalizing (if
flexible) dominant culture makes dissensus impossible.

### Materiality and Social Formation in the Frontier Thesis

Why link density with the frontier, though, and how is it possible that the
frontier would have just as much to do with an urban setting as a rural one?
Density's association with the frontier is in part the remnant of a bygone
geographical measurement, but the cultural significance of this marginal state
is established by Frederick Jackson Turner's influential discussion of the
frontier's *end*. Geographically, the frontier is the "margin" of a settlement
and an area with two inhabitants or fewer per square mile (US Census Bureau,
Turner 199). But to Turner, the frontier is "is the outer edge of the wave--
the meeting point between savagery and civilization," less a matter of figures
than of valuation (200). 

Nevertheless, in understanding the basis of this valuation, he draws an
important link for frontier mentality with density itself:

> The American frontier is sharply distinguished from the European frontier---a
fortified boundary line running through dense populations. The most significant
thing about the American frontier is, that it lies at the hither edge of free
land. (200)

What Turner calls the "hither edge of free land" we must in 2016 rephrase as
the "hither edge of seizable land," but the distinction can nevertheless be
useful. The relative density of contiguous areas gives rise to entirely
distinct cultural forms. The European frontier is an imaginary line drawn based
on premises entirely cultural and political. The American frontier is defined
by the social and cultural tendencies that result from encounters with a more
material (and therefore more fundamental) difference in land use.

This material determination of social forms by density is too complex to be
called mechanistic, but to Turner's mind it exhibits a clear trend in which the
old-world and new-world material base give rise to drastically different types
of development. The version of social development that occurs in situations of
high density includes the "evolution of institutions...such as the rise of
representative government; the differentiation of simple colonial governments
into complex organs; the progress from primitive industrial society, without
division of labor, up to manufacturing civilization" (200). European,
high-density development takes the form of increasing complexity because
expansion is impossible. This description has interesting (if, perhaps,
unintended) resonances with a Marxist base-superstructure theory of historical
development, in which changes to the "real foundation" of a given society
correspond to changes in the "legal and political superstructure...to which
correspond definite forms of social consciousness" (qtd. in Williams 75).
Turner's major contribution in this light is to add population density as a
major determinant in frontier contexts, but it is hardly a single determining
variable. Conditions of high density rely not only on the material conditions
of production and distribution. They also rely on the foundation of all
material relations, the conditions of the soil in an ever-changing landscape
(or the means to import the fruits of such soil from elsewhere).[^soil]
Therefore, the European form of development-as-complexity *has* to take into
consideration the conditions that enable it. For every high-density form of
society, there is a division of labor that goes beyond its bounds, whether it
is the "country" immediately beyond the "city" or someone else's country,
coopted for the sustenance of cities far away.[^world-ecology] This elaboration
will become important when discussing the frontier in the eyes of
soil-conscious novelists like Norris and Gilman.

The endless expanse of "country" in America, so long as it existed, allowed for
continual development by expansion simultaneously with development by
complexity. The frontier is continually settled then, a "wave" of density
moving outwards, but in the region just behind the wave a Europeanization of
frontier development occurs, and it begins to resemble development in heavily
populated areas. As the frontier continues to move outwards, Turner suggests,
we witness in what *was* frontier a "recurrence of the process of evolution in
each western area reached in the process of expansion," or in other words, a
shift from the limitless (American) paradigm of the frontier to the dense and
limited (European) paradigm (200). Here, then, is the real loss of the
frontier---not the loss of density *per se*, as the quantitative thinking of
the census bureau might have us believe. The movement of the American frontier
is a situation of changing density, but its loss results from a shifting
dialectical relationship between land and social formations in which this
density figures as an essential middle term. 

In the literature, we see a response to this loss. The response takes the form
of attempted reclamation, which is always impossible. But the form these
responses take bears a clear relation to the relevant conditions of density.

### Community Without Density on the Vanishing Frontier

In Norris's novels, areas of low density are utopian spaces representing a
freedom to live as one wants out of reach of modernity's rules and cultural
restrictions. Communities of miners give McTeague an alternative social
structure to the dominant "civilized" culture of the city in which is
indefatigable nature finds a sort of peace (despite his death). *The Octopus*
dramatizes the loss of the communal autonomy McTeague revels in. Presley and
the rural farmers idealize their autonomy and political creativity, but are
unable to save it from the logic of expansion: the "country" and its social
forms are subsumed to the needs of the city. In other words, high-density
subsumes low-density in the expanding division of labor.

It is strange to say that McTeague finds his fullest expression in the very
environment kills him (the expanse of unsettled desert land makes his rescue
impossible), but his own response to it leaves no room for doubt. The novel
concludes with the flight from high-density, settled city to the low-density
frontier in which McTeague's brutish, uncivilized nature finds the last shreds
of the environment in which it is able to be viable. We must say "last shreds"
because the fragility of the frontier is painfully clear: Iowa Hill, McTeague's
first frontier destination, is a "one-street town" that was once "on the summit
of a mountain, but the sides of this mountain have long since been
'hydraulicked' away, so that the town now clings to a mere back bone" (209).
The very environment on which McTeague's full self-expression relies is being
stripped for the raw materials high-density development requires---with special
emphasis put on the industrial means of production with "hydraulicked," a word
emphasizing the complexity and scale of the operation. 

McTeague in part identifies with the land itself, but also the communal
structures that arise from it. When he finds "a resemblance between his present
work [as a miner] and the profession he had been forced to abandon," he is
really recognizing his attempt to maintain a low-density identity in a
high-density environment. He is also recalling that he "had been forced to
abandon" dentistry because of the complex legal structures density
necessitates: where he was able to simply *do* dentistry in his frontier
apprenticeship, legal strictures force him to discontinue his practice in the
city. Everything in these marginal zones works according to the laws of the
American West in which he was raised, and which instilled in him a set of
values and proclivities that are unable to withstand the "domesticated" culture
of high-density environments. The fundamental proposition of base and
superstructure that Raymond Williams identifies somewhat dubiously, "that
social being determines consciousness," is true in Norris's universe, but it
can be specified: conditions of density determine social being, which in turn
determines consciousness (Williams 75).

McTeague moves from high density to low, and thereby regains (however briefly)
the agency to live in a social structure from which he is not estranged; the
more representative narrative depicts the loss of low-density community
structures in the face of the dominant culture of density. In *The Octopus*,
the more affirming social relations of low-density localism---the individual
ranch, the community of farmers, the commonwealth---are destroyed by the
margin's incorporation in a larger division of labor determined and controlled
by areas of greater density. As a modern agricultural system is being built,
its beneficiaries violently establish a flow of material energy in the form of
nutrients, with tons of wheat flowing from the low-density communities of
farmers to the high-density urban communities. The narrative maps to the life
cycle of a single crop of wheat, from sowing the seeds to distributing the
harvest; but in the process, the product is appropriated by the forces
establishing a global distribution of nutrients. In the simpler, less developed
division of labor in lower-density communities, the farmer would be responsible
for every step in the process and the energy embodied in the harvest would stay
local to the community. Instead, capital and energy alike both flow to the
higher-density urban areas (represented by Shelgrim and the city council he
keeps in his pocket), destroying the sustaining base of low-density social
structures. 

In the context of this wholesale destruction (or, perhaps, destruction by
wholesale), the "frontier" becomes a concept for resistance. It only exists in
the minds of the farmers who believe that, by voluntary enclosure and by
removing themselves from the global market, they can hold on to the autonomous
communal structures. This in turn requires the invention of new political and
legal structures. But these structures can only become *actual* rather than
merely speculative with the political agency enabled by the low-density
frontier. The ultimate defeat of these farmers---the infiltration and
destruction of their movement for change---becomes coextensive with the final
destruction of the frontier in the Joaquin Valley.

The "frontier" appears as the glorification of low population density, as is
most distinctly evident in the cultural production this lack of density
inspires: Presley's largely hypothetical "Epic of the West," which is abandoned
when the truth of global markets becomes inescapable. Arriving in San Joaquin
from the highly developed East Coast, he deduces "that his poem should be of
the West, that world's frontier of Romance, where a new race, a new
people---hardy, brave, and passionate---were building an empire" (7). The
frontier, because it is on the cusp of being lost, becomes the "frontier of
Romance." It also becomes predicated on the construction of a new society by
"new people," establishing an outsiders view of the same frontier society
McTeague understands as his true home.

The destruction of this frontier vision is just as clearly correlated with
density. The power and inspiration Presley draws from the emptiness of the
frontier, a perspective on high from which he imagines himself to have
"dominated the entire country," is punctuated by images of agricultural density
in the production systems that enable *human* density (34). From his vantage
point, he also sees a "mass" of sheep, "compact, solid, slowly moving...huge
without form, like a thick-pressed growth of mushrooms, spreading out in all
directions over the earth" (22). This mass is obliterated when, finding a seam
in a fence, they wander onto the train tracks and are slaughtered *en masse* by
Shelgrims railroad (35). The image is repeated, with a more obvious narrative
function, later: the farmers engage in a jack-rabbit hunt, the strategy for
which is to drive the jack rabbits out from their individual existences,
mobilize them into a herd, enclose them, and begin the slaughter. The process
is described: "Denser and denser grew the throng. In all directions nothing was
to be seen but the loose mass of the moving jacks....It was no longer a herd
covering the earth. It was a sea, whipped into confusion, tossing incessantly,
leaping, falling, agitated by unseen forces" (343). This situation that ends in
slaughter prefigures the later gathering of "The League" of organized farmers,
in what seems to be the prelude to revolution: rallied into life, the farmers
march towards the center of San Joaquin, where "great, tumultuous heavings,
like ground-swells of an incoming tide, surged over and through the multitude"
as they are pushed toward the enclosure of the Opera House (374). When they
arrive, a carefully calculated counter-revolutionary campaign discredits the
speakers and disperses the crowd, symbolically slaughtering the revolutionary
ambitions of the crowd. Just as the increasing density of sheep and jack
rabbits leads to their slaughter, the pastoral life of low-density communities
are destroyed as soon as they encounter conditions of population density
themselves.

Every image of density is also an image of loss: the loss of frontier
communities which are always glorified and which always rely on political
agency that is only possible in sparsely populated lands. It is impossible to
separate the increase in density from the rise of a globalized division of
labor: the novel ends with the establishment of a global wheat market. But
Norris does not demonstrate what the creation of community looks like when
carved out of urban density---on Turner's "European" frontier. For that
depiction, we have to turn to Roth.

### Immigrants and High-Density Frontier Communities

It is impossible to reasonably sustain Turner's differentiation between the
European and the American frontier for long when we recognize that for many
twentieth-century immigrants to America, the conditions that define the
European, high-density "frontier" were mirrored in the high-density urban
environments into which they arrived. In Henry Roth's depiction of this urban
life in *Call It Sleep*, the frontier is not threatened and vanishing by a
global system of density, as it is in Norris's novels, nor is it arrested in a
utopian state of purity as (we shall see) it is in Gilman's. For Roth's
European-American, the frontier is simultaneously always already lost as an
object of desire and paradoxically relocated onto Europe itself. But this
ultimate unattainability of the frontier results in reproduction of the
European communities, even those of rural villages, but in the highest-density
conditions imaginable. What they find is a sharply curtailed freedom to create
any new social form that might account for the interaction between culture and
the material conditions. Their choices, rather, are to accept one of two
dominant cultural paradigms of their very full new world: the European
traditions they come from or assimilationist American culture. In either case,
the European-American frontier is of a kind with the high-density European
frontier that Turner ignores[^turner-europeans] in the American urban
landscape, with all the attendant political constraints. 

In the first case, identification with European traditions, a peculiar
operation occurs in the concept of the "frontier": when America proves to have
lost the frontier in pursuit of which the immigrants arrived, the referent for
a low-density lifestyle paradoxically reverts to the European landscape itself.
One day, David's mother brings home "a picture of a small patch of ground full
of tall green stalks, at the foot of which, tiny blue flowers grew" (169). In
the context of their Lower East Side apartment, such open space is
unimaginable, especially for David, who does not recognize the "tall green
stalks" as corn. His mother has to tell him, "It grows out of the earth, you
know, the sweet corn in the summer---it isn't made by pushcart peddlers" (169).
The cultural loss of both agricultural knowledge and the social formations that
come with it mirrors the loss of the frontier in Norris's narratives. The
place that enables a more harmonious interplay between self and environment is
always disappearing just before one gets there---and the form of its
disappearance is density. 

The American form of the frontier, then, disappears for European-American
immigrants in its displacement onto an unattainable homeland. In its place is
the European frontier, the "line running through dense populations" that Turner
defines in his frontier thesis. In *Call It Sleep*, this "line" is established
not by national boundaries, but by contiguous spheres of cultural influence in
the areas of highest urban density. The limits of cultural expansion in this
dense environment are established as the cultural loss that occurs when the
boundaries of a cultural enclave are breeched by its members.

Cultural loss takes two forms: assimilation and the threat of destruction. When
David climbs to the roof of his building---a vista from which the entire city
and all of its many cultural enclaves are available to him---he encounters Leo,
a Polish-American Christian whom David finds immediately seductive (296-9). The
artifacts of Leo's cultural difference so enthrall David that he eventually
sells sexual access to his step-cousin for the price of a rosary, the ultimate
act of cultural abnegation. Density in this case results in an encounter
between cultures, nearly precluding David's access to his family's traditional
culture. Because this traditional culture is David's nearest proxy to the space
and culture represented in his mother's picture, assimilation threatens to
overwrite low-density culture (the Old World, which has become for David the
frontier image) with high-density culture (assimilation and cultural melange). 

As with the lost rural communities of Norris's novels, the stirrings of a
global economy can be credited with the loss of the cultural forms enabled by
the frontier and areas of low density. Just outside the novel's consciousness
are the economic forces motivating the increase in density, as the metropolitan
division of labor requires more and more workers for its sustenance.
Immigration forms a globalized version of the reserve army of labor, a term
coined by Engels and picked up by Marx in the first volume of *Capital* to
describe the surplus population maintained by the forces of capitalism to keep
labor costs low (and therefore maintain the production of surplus value) (Marx
352). The cultural expression of the reserve army of labor is cultural
compression in urban conditions of density. What we see in Roth's narrative is
that cultural agency---the agency to fully assimilate without consequence, to
maintain a cultural identity in new material conditions, or to create an
entirely new form that shares aspects of both---is suppressed by the inexorable
forces of density.[^globalization-dialectic]

### Limited Density, Frozen Frontier

Gilman: reconstruction of the frontier, narratively; invocation of the frontier
in history and apocalyptic event. Limitation of density as a function of
carrying capacity. 

The society of Herland is a re-establishment of the frontier precisely because
it rejects the conditions of density that are so fundamental to modernity.

...

Herland, then, may adopt certain models of high-density community in the way
that it mimics globalization's creation of a total system. But in the biosocial
systems it establishes for itself, it makes density a structural impossibility
by setting its carrying capacity at such a low level. To put this operation in
terms of the frontier---for the frontier as it has been discussed here is
finally a product of density---the controlled carrying capacity arrests the
frontier as in a snow globe, preventing it from expanding or contracting. And
with the frontier, it arrests frontier-like conditions of communalism.

This is hardly Norris's frontier of jubilant savagery, though, as is evident
from the way the Herlanders treat wildness. Gilman's re-construction of the
frontier rewrites the entire narrative of expansionist progress, including the
premise that increasing expansion and increasing density lead out of savagery
and into civilization.

...


### Conclusion: The White Frontier

It is no coincidence that a hermeneutic principle criticized for its
indifference to history's victims fails to account for non-white literary
histories. It hardly needs to be reiterated (and yet needs always to be
reiterated despite) that the "hither edge of free land" in Turner's thesis had
on the other side of it, not empty space, but societies that fall under the
categorization of "savagery" in this estimation. But also absent from this
frontier theory of literary density are the narratives of the invisible labor
force pushing the frontier forward---a movement that, in Turner's hands, is
entirely naturalized and without mechanism or agent, as though the frontier
border were literally blown forth by the winds of "progress." 

For black voices, a different perspective is required, but perhaps not an
entirely new paradigm. ... [Speed round of Hurston, Invisible Man, Black Boy.]

[^globalization-dialectic]: There isn't space to develop this, but I don't want
to delete the following idea. In these conditions of high density,
globalization is in a dialectical relationship with localism: even as it
dismantles the communities on which the very concept of "local" rely, it
reproduces them in compressed miniature. These communities in turn both further
the progress of globalization by contributing to its division of labor and make
that globality more visible by sheer concentration of difference.
